                <p>
                I'm a second year Computer Science major from Duluth, GA.  <br>
                I'm passionate about making a positive impact in my community. <br>
                Whether it's volunteering to support education, participating in environmental initiatives, or mentoring young individuals, my commitment remains steadfast.
                I firmly believe that contributing to the well-being of others and fostering 
                a sense of global togetherness are equally vital aspects of creating positive change.
